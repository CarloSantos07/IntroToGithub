# Intro To Github

Welcome to class. First things first, let's get in touch with our tools.
Within the development industry when we build something, we usually build in 
large teams. The really powerful programs require many people working on the
project together as a team. A problem that arises when multiple people are working on
code in the same project, is that we may change code that affects another contributors code.
No good.

In comes version control. Git is an example of a version control system. Version control is 
simply that. Version control systems (VCS's) track and manage the version/state of the source code. 
So we can rewind in the history of our code and fastforward to our most recent contribution.

No better way to learn than to get started. Clone this repo and follow along.
