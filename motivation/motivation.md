Name: Carlo  
Motivation:   
 To teach others to create for themselves. The goal of the class is to learn how to learn. My motivation is to help you find your inner success. A true teacher does not try to mold the student but removes obstacles that may slow down the learning process. My aim is to get you paid, but the desire must be there. More than ever developers and programmers are needed in every field from medicine, to space, to art, and so much more. Helping you to develop yourself even after this class is my aim.
